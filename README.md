# Rotation-Scale-invariant-CNN
Convolutional neural network (2D index) approximate invariant properties implicitly by max-pooling. Thus filters fail to generalize with drastic changes in scale and rotation. In this page, I show 2D convolution on "Frequency" &amp; "Direction" is a natural way to think of scaling and rotation.
